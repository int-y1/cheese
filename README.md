A repository for cheesing problems in programming contests. Or for making your programs run really fast.

fastio.cpp - Useful for problems with a lot of input (at least 5 MB). Make sure that `NOT_DMOJ` is defined by the compiler, and `data.txt` contains sample input.

ds.cpp - Fast data structures.

TODO:
- Add explanations.
